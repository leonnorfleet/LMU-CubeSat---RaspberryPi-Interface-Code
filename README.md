The code in this repo is for allowing a Raspberry Pi model 3B+ to be used as an I2C slave device and interfaced with a Pumpkin Space CubeSat onboard computer.

There is auxillary code in uart_test.py and logs_queue.py that are required for the Pi to simulate creating logs of detected jamming attacks and sending them to the CubeSat computer via I2c using pigpio.
